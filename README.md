# university_grade_updater
This is a piece of referral coursework that I had to do in Java. It uses and array list made in the student class and a module class to store the information provided by the user in the user interaction class. The user enters their name, course and how many modules they have, the application then asks them to enter their module code, module name and grade. Once all of this has been entered the program prints the data back to the user and then asks them if they want to update their grade by asking for their module code to locate the correct module and then a new grade to replace the previous one. Once this has been done the program displays the grades with their updated values.
